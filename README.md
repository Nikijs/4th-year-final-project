# 4th-year-final-project
This will be a 2D grid based multiplayer survival game inspired by "Dont starve together".
This game will be made using Unity Real-Time Development Platform and i will use Photon Unity 3D Networking Framework to handle the multiplayer aspect of the game. Initially i wish to use MongoDB for my database, depending on its compatability with Unity, i may switch to Database Control from the Unity Asset Store.
The goal is to procedurally generate the game terrain and the assets needed for the players to survive. Time/days survived will be tracked and the players will have to scavenge for resources to keep their hunger bar from dropping to zero. Once the hunger bar drops to zero for all the players in the map, the game will be lost.
